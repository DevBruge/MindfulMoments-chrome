---

###Under Development 

####TODO
1. ~~figure out how to create a event page extension~~
2. ~~make event page alert us every x seconds~~
3. ~~add randomness to the alert~~
4. ~~add an options page to configure randomness and the message text~~
5. ~~determine best notification mechanism (alert vs. chrome notifications vs. popup vs. ding sound...etc)~~
6. hook up the pieces:
    1. make sound an option for all notification modes > MJ
    2. hook up notifications with the options page (load defaults if user doesn't override options page) > MJ
    3. choose a random message from the list of available messages > MJ
    4. add enriched notifications > Chris
    5. add time interval options page (notify me every x mins (+/- y mins)) > Chris
        - (make the instructions user friendly)
    6. find 1 zen picture > Mei-Yan/Chris
    7. find 1 zen sound > Rami/MJ 

####Features parking lot:
- don't let alerts/notifications pile up if user is not at desk
- JS namespacing
- find multiple zen picures, choose randomly
- finding multiple zen sounds, choose randomly
- update JavaScript styling of options and notifications pages
- format a better CSS style sheet (a priority when tackling different versions/themes)
